# Stitch in a Minute: Reading Data from Atlas

Let's update the [previous page](../crud-1) web page we used
previously to insert some data to the employee collection.

## What's Next?

- I've seen enough CRUD, and this security issue is bothering me. [Let's fix it.](../rules-1)
- I want to learn more about [MongoDB's CRUD operations.](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/)
- CRUD is easy; take me to the [Authentication docs.](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/authentication/)
- I want to [start playing with my own data in Stitch.](http://stitch.mongodb.com)

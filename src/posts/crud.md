# Stitch in a Minute: Reading Data from Atlas

Get started with MongoDB Stitch by reading some sample Employee data that we've
loaded into a MongoDB Atlas database.

You can connect to Stitch with multiple platforms and languages, but for now we'll
build a simple Javascript page to display the employee data.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" style="width: 1600px;">
  <strong>Do Try This At Home</strong>
  <br />
  The code on this page should run on your computer with no changes. To test
  this out, copy the code into an empty html file. When you open the file in a
  browser (with an internet connection), you will see a table that lists
  employee names, titles and salaries.
</div>

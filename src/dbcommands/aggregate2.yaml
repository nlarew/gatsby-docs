      type: "boolean",
      optional: true

      type: "boolean",
      optional: true

    description: >
      Enables writing to temporary files. When set to true,
      aggregation stages can write data to the _tmp subdirectory in the
      dbPath directory.

  - fieldName: cursor2
    value: {
      text: "<document>",
      type: "document",
      optional: true
    }
    description: >

  - fieldName: maxTimeMS2
    value: {
      text: "<int>",
      type: "non-negative integer",
      optional: true
    }
    description: >
      Specifies a time limit in milliseconds for processing operations
      on a cursor. If you do not specify a value for maxTimeMS,
      operations will not time out. A value of 0 explicitly specifies
      the default unbounded behavior.
      
      MongoDB terminates operations that exceed their allotted time
      limit using the same mechanism as db.killOp(). MongoDB only
      terminates an operation at one of its designated interrupt points.
  - fieldName: bypassDocumentValidation2
    value: {
      text: "<boolean>",
      type: "boolean",
      optional: true
    }
    description: >
      Available only if you specify the $out aggregation operator.

      Enables aggregate to bypass document validation during the
      operation. This lets you insert documents that do not meet the
      validation requirements.
